 <h1>The Best Movies According to Ananya</h1>

 <h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>A girl walks alone at night</h3>
 <p>It's a must watch! Beautufully uses satire and horror to showcase issues that exist in our society, from the point of view of a woman</p>

 <h3>Kiki's delivery service</h3>
 <p>One can never go wrong with Ghibli movies, and if you are feeling stuck, and demotivated, this movie woukd be a good watch!</p>

 <h3>Mr and Mrs Iyer</h3>
 <p>Again, a must watch. It's one of those Indian films that feels fresh, and has a much different story line, and is unconventional!</p>
